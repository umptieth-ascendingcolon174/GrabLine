"""Worker-thread infrastructure for the main window: the off-the-GUI-thread
resolve and file-operation threads, and the progress relay that marshals a
worker's progress back onto the GUI thread. Kept out of main_window.py so the
window file is about the window, not thread plumbing.

Lifetime note: these threads are parented (or handed to ``threads.retain``) by
their caller so a dropped Python reference can never destroy a still-running
QThread - the crash class fixed app-wide.
