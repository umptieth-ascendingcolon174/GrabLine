"""The segmented downloader: N parallel range connections with checkpointed,
crash-safe resume (F0.1, F0.2).

Crash-safety model
------------------
Workers write with unbuffered file handles (``buffering=0``), so every byte a
worker counts as downloaded has already been handed to the OS page cache -
which survives a kill -9 of this process. Segment progress is checkpointed to
SQLite (WAL) shortly *after* the bytes are written, never before, so a recorded
offset can only ever lag the file, and resuming from it merely rewrites a few
already-correct bytes. A crash therefore loses at most one checkpoint interval
of progress, never integrity.
