<br />

Paste a URL, drop one on the window, or click the GrabLine button in your browser.
Files run over many connections (up to 32). Videos and audio open a quality panel (4K to 144p, MP3, M4A or FLAC, subtitles, trim) on 1000+ sites via yt dlp. Magnets, torrent files, SFTP, FTP, S3, WebDAV, and public Drive or Dropbox links open in the same app.

No ads. No paid tier. No usage telemetry to us. AGPL 3.0.
GrabLine is built in spare time. If it saves you hassle, [buy me a coffee][support]. It keeps the project alive.

## What you get

* **Accelerator:** up to 32 connections per file, dynamic segmentation, HTTP/2, resume that survives a hard kill, mirror failover.
* **Browser button:** hover media or right click links; handoff over Native Messaging (no open ports).
* **Video and audio:** yt dlp in process: quality picks, playlists, SponsorBlock, chapters, clip trim.
* **Torrents:** libtorrent (same engine family as qBittorrent): magnets, DHT, sequential streaming, seed ratios, RSS.
* **Cloud:** SFTP, FTP, S3, WebDAV with OS keychain secrets; Drive and Dropbox share links as direct downloads.
* **Queue control:** named queues, schedules, priorities, dependencies, category auto sort.
* **Network:** HTTP, HTTPS and SOCKS proxies for downloads and torrents; global, per job and per host caps.
* **Dashboard:** live speed, totals, graphs for download, upload, CPU, disk and network.
* **Advisory security:** checksums and optional scans warn; they never quarantine your file.

<details>
<summary><b>Engine and network detail</b></summary>

* Dynamic segmentation: a free connection steals work from the slowest one.
* Checkpointed progress across power loss and VPN reconnects; retry forever option.
* Per host speed buckets so one greedy site cannot starve the rest.
* Polite mode eases off when you need the link for something else.
* Battery pause and “shut down when done” for overnight batches.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Browser extension (GrabLine Connect)</b></summary>

* Firefox: signed on [AMO][amo].
* Chrome, Edge, Brave and others: pair from **Browser Setup** inside the app.
* Hover button, right click download, per tab sniffed streams, download takeover (on by default; toggle in the extension popup).

## Download and install

Get the latest files from the **[releases page][releases]**. No Python required for the packaged builds.

| System | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | `Grabline Setup *.exe` | Or a Windows portable zip without admin rights. |
| **macOS** | `Grabline * applesilicon.dmg` | Apple Silicon (M1 and later). |
| **Linux** | DEB, AppImage or tar.gz | Use tar.gz when FUSE is missing. |

Builds are **unsigned**, so the OS warns once. [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) has the exact clicks. Then install the extension (Firefox from AMO; other browsers from the app’s Browser Setup).

## Everyday use

| You do | GrabLine does |
| --- | --- |
| Hover a video, GrabLine button | Opens Download Info: name, folder, quality (Best, 1080p, MP3, …). |
| Right click, *Download with GrabLine* | Routes to the right engine. |
| Paste or drop a URL | Queues (or opens the quality panel for smart sites). |
| Select a row | Details drawer: speed graph, ETA, destination. |
| Menu, Grab Site / Import Links | Crawl a page or expand numbered file patterns. |

## Honest limits

* **No DRM circumvention.** Netflix, Prime, Disney+, Spotify tracks, etc. are refused clearly.
* **No login bypass.** Optional “use my browser session” reads *your* cookies for *your* downloads; they are not uploaded to us.
* You are responsible for site terms and local law.
